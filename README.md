## What is Molt?
Molt is a meditation/relaxation app that helps you get into the right headspace by shedding your stressful thoughts.

## How does it work?
A user first decides on the length of their session and how many stressful thoughts or distractions are currently on their mind. Before the session begins those stressful thoughts, represented by sticky notes with scribbles, are scattered on a wall. The user then removes each one with the goal of leaving shedding those thoughts for now. Once the stickies have been removed, the session begins with a calming nature photo background and a timer counting down. When the session has finished the phone vibrates and the user can write down a journal entry on a single sticky note in a colour chosen by the user.

A list of finished sessions can be viewed from the main screen. Each one has a date, time, stress level, session length, goal length, journal entry and color. Finished sessions have a checkmark.

## Inspiration
We wanted to build a meditation/relaxation app that involved some kind of user interaction. The UI was going to be custom but built out of SwiftUI components.

## How we built it/ Challenges we ran into
As a team of four, we split up different SwiftUI views and built it piece by piece. The sticky note, the wall of stickies, the parameter view, the journal view, etc. Some of the more custom elements like the sticky stack slider and the bottom sheet were quite difficult. As SwiftUI can only handle 3d rotations, the sticky note curl is a faked effect with animated curves and a gradient to appear as if it curves upward.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Mainly we're proud of how we came together as a team. When the deadline for the hackathon hit the app wasn't completely finished but that was ok. We all learned a lot about SwiftUI and git mainly by asking each other questions.

## What's next for Molt?
It's coming to the app store soon in a completed state but the features are still minimal.
